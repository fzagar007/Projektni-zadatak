			<h2>New Audi Q6 e-tron: details and specs of 2022 electric SUV</h2>
			<p class="description">All we know so far about the new Audi Q6 e-tron - which uses an all-new platform jointly developed with Porsche.</p>
			<p>Audi is expanding its range of fully electric models to four in 2022, with the new Q6 e-tron joining the smaller Q4 e-tron, the existing e-tron and the e-tron GT. </p>
			<p>Set to sit between the Q4 and the larger e-tron SUV when it arrives next year, the Q6 e-tron will also be the first Audi based on the Volkswagen Group’s new Premium Platform Electric (PPE) architecture, which has been jointly developed with Porsche.</p>
			<p>Recently spyshots show the model will adapt the look of the smaller Q4 e-tron, as well as bearing some cues from the 2016 Q6 e-tron quattro concept. Influence from the e-tron GT four-door coupe is also visible, with similarly shaped headlamps and “radiator” grille, and a familiar full-width LED light-bar across the car’s tailgate. </p>
			<p>In profile it features a longer bonnet than the Q4 e-tron, but shares a similar shoulderline, sloping roofline and tailgate spoiler. It’s expected the Q6 will be comparable in external dimensions to the combustion-engined Q5, but with a longer wheelbase and increased passenger space enabled by the new platform. We could also see a more sportily styled Sportback model join the range soon after, if the brand’s other electric SUVs are anything to go by. </p>
            <p>Inside, the car is likely to adopt the new 11.6-inch central touchscreen used in the Q4 e-tron, which is the largest single display ever fitted to a production Audi. However, the design could be different due to the platform, and also to separate both models in terms of price and positioning.  </p>
