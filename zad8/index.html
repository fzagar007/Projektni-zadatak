		<p>The invention of the first model electric vehicle is attributed to various people. In 1828, the Hungarian priest and physicist Ányos Jedlik invented an early type of electric motor, and created a small model car powered by his new motor. Between 1832 and 1839, Scottish inventor Robert Anderson also invented a crude electric carriage. In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker from Germany also created a small-scale electric car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.</p>
		<p>Rechargeable batteries that provided a viable means for storing electricity on board a vehicle did not come into being until 1859, with the invention of the lead–acid battery by French physicist Gaston Planté. Camille Alphonse Faure, another French scientist, significantly improved the design of the battery in 1881; his improvements greatly increased the capacity of such batteries and led directly to their manufacture on an industrial scale</p>
		<p>Interest in motor vehicles increased greatly in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century. In London, Walter Bersey designed a fleet of such cabs and introduced them to the streets of London in 1897.</p>
		<p>They were soonrgb(15, 15, 15)gbirds" due to the idiosyncratic humming noise they made. In the same year in New York City, the Samuel's Electric Carriage and Wagon Company began running 12 electric hansom cabs. The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form the Electric Vehicle Company.</p>
		<p>Today there are so many electric cars around the world. One of the best one is Rimac and Tesla. Fastest one is Rimac Nevera.</p>
		<p>Each of the Nevera's four wheels is individually driven by surface-mounted magnet motors. Combined, they produce a total of 1914 hp and 2360Nm of torque. A single-stage gearbox links the front and rear wheels. The Nevera allegedly has the ability to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 1.85 seconds, making it potentially the fastest-accelerating production car in the world. According to the Rimac Automobili, it will accelerate from 0-100 mph in 4.3 seconds, 0-186 mph in 9.3 seconds, and on to a top speed of 412 km/h or 256 mph.</p>
