			<h2>FORD PLANNING TO NEARLY DOUBLE ALL-ELECTRIC F-150 LIGHTNING PRODUCTION</h2>
			<p class="description">Ford is planning to nearly double production capacity of the all-electric F-150 Lightning™ pickup to 150,000 vehicles per year at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, to meet soaring customer demand.</p>
			<p>F-150 Lightning moves to the final phase of pre-production as pickups roll off the line for real-world durability and thousands of miles of testing ahead of customer deliveries this spring.</p>
			<p>On Thursday, the first wave of reservation holders for F-150 Lightning will start converting their reservations to orders; additional reservation holders will be invited in phases to place their order over the next few months. For those who don’t receive invites for the 2022 model year, there will be an opportunity to order for future model years.</p>
			<p>With unprecedented demand for the Mustang Mach-E, Ford earlier announced it will increase production starting this year and expects to reach 200,000-plus units per year by 2023; within 24 months, Ford will have the global capacity to produce 600,000 battery electric vehicles annually.</p>
			<p>DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 4, 2022, Ford Motor Company said today it is planning to nearly double production of the F-150 Lightning™ pickup at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn to 150,000 trucks per year to meet high demand for the first all-electric version of America’s best-selling vehicle, the F-Series. And beginning Thursday, the first group of reservation holders will be invited to place their orders for the F-150 Lightning.</p>
			<p>“With nearly 200,000 reservations, our teams are working hard and creatively to break production constraints to get more F-150 Lightning trucks into the hands of our customers,” said Kumar Galhotra, president of The Americas & International Markets Group, Ford Motor Company. “The reality is clear: People are ready for an all-electric F-150 and Ford is pulling out all the stops to scale our operations and increase production capacity.”.</p>
